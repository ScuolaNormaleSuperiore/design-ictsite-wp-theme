# CLAUDE.md

Claude Code-specific entry point.

## Bootstrap
Read `AGENTS/AGENTS_README.md` and follow its `Session bootstrap` sequence.

## Claude Code Notes
- Use plan mode for non-trivial tasks (new features, multi-file refactors, architectural decisions).
- Prefer atomic `Edit` operations over full file rewrites — smaller diffs are easier to review.
- Use `Glob`/`Grep` for directed searches; use the Explore agent for broader codebase discovery.
- Run `composer run lint:php` before finalizing code changes when dependencies are available.
- Keep naming and structure aligned with WordPress conventions.
