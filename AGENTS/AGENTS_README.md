# AGENTS_README.md

## Purpose
This directory provides AI-oriented directives and project context to support development, maintenance, bug fixing, and security hardening.


## Session bootstrap
Run this section only once at session start, unless the user explicitly asks to reload AGENTS context. First read the root entry point for the active agent: `AGENTS.md` for ChatGPT Codex, or `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code. Then read every file currently in `AGENTS/` in this exact order:

1. `AGENTS/AGENTS_README.md` (this file).
2. `AGENTS/PROJECT.md`.
3. `AGENTS/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
4. `AGENTS/AI_BEHAVIOR.md`.
5. `AGENTS/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
6. `AGENTS/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`.
7. Report `Bootstrap completed` and the full list of files read, including the applicable root entry point.
8. List the skills available in the current session. Explicitly state whether applicable official WordPress skills are loaded; if they are not, notify the human operator.
9. List the available trigger commands from `AGENTS/AI_BEHAVIOR.md` using the format: `/slug` - Trigger X: brief description.
10. Ask the human operator which project task they want to work on.


## File Map
- `../AGENTS.md` / `../CLAUDE.md`: agent-specific entry points and instructions (Codex/ChatGPT and Claude Code).
- `PROJECT.md`: project description, product scope, main features, roles.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: architecture description, main modules, key directories, bootstrap, public hooks/endpoints, data model, technology stack, references.
- `CODING_STANDARDS.md`: coding constraints and quality standards.
- `AI_BEHAVIOR.md`: workflow rules and issue management.
- `DEV/CODE_REVIEW/ISSUES_TODO.md`: active backlog. Private and never committed; created on demand if missing.
- `DEV/CODE_REVIEW/ISSUES_RESOLVED.md`: resolved issue archive. Private and never committed; created on demand if missing. Write-mostly: append to it when an issue is
  closed, but read it only when strictly necessary, and by searching it rather than loading
  it in full (see "Reading policy for the issue files" in `AI_BEHAVIOR.md`).
- `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`: branch, commit, and PR conventions.


## Reload trigger
Re-run the full "Session bootstrap" only when the user explicitly asks, using phrases like:
- "reload agents"
- "re-read AGENTS"
- "refresh AGENTS context"
