# AI_BOOTSTRAP.md

## Purpose
This directory provides AI-oriented directives and project context to support development, maintenance, bug fixing, and security hardening.


## Session bootstrap
Run this section only once at session start, unless the user explicitly asks to reload AGENTS context. First read the root entry point for the active agent: `AGENTS.md` for ChatGPT Codex, or `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code. Then read only these versioned instruction files in this exact order:

1. `AGENTS/AI_BOOTSTRAP.md` (this file).
2. `AGENTS/PROJECT.md`.
3. `AGENTS/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
4. `AGENTS/AI_BEHAVIOR.md`.
5. `AGENTS/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
6. `AGENTS/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`.
7. Ensure `AGENTS/ISSUES_TODO.md` and `AGENTS/ISSUES_RESOLVED.md` exist. If missing, create local Markdown files containing only `# ISSUES TODO` and `# ISSUES RESOLVED`, respectively. These files are ignored by Git and must never be committed. Do not read either file during bootstrap.
8. Do not read `AGENTS/CODE_REVIEW.md` during bootstrap; read it only when Trigger F (`/code-review`) runs.
9. Report exactly: `Bootstrap completed` + the full list of files read, including the applicable root entry point.
10. List the skills available in the current session. Explicitly state whether applicable official WordPress skills are loaded; if they are not, notify the human operator.
11. List the available trigger commands from `AGENTS/AI_BEHAVIOR.md` using the format: `Trigger X` (`/slug`) — brief description.
12. State: `Local issue files ensured: AGENTS/ISSUES_TODO.md, AGENTS/ISSUES_RESOLVED.md (created if missing; never commit them).`
13. Ask the human operator which project task they want to work on.


## File Map
- `../AGENTS.md` / `../CLAUDE.md`: agent-specific entry points and instructions (Codex/ChatGPT and Claude Code).
- `PROJECT.md`: project description, product scope, main features, roles.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: architecture description, main modules, key directories, bootstrap, public hooks/endpoints, data model, technology stack, references.
- `CODING_STANDARDS.md`: coding constraints and quality standards.
- `AI_BEHAVIOR.md`: workflow rules and issue management.
- `CODE_REVIEW.md`: public review method, evidence, coverage and project plan; read only by Trigger F.
- `ISSUES_TODO.md`: ignored local backlog, ensured during bootstrap and read by issue workflows.
- `ISSUES_RESOLVED.md`: ignored local archive, ensured during bootstrap and searched only when required.
- `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`: branch, commit, and PR conventions.


## Reload trigger
Re-run the full "Session bootstrap" only when the user explicitly asks, using phrases like:
- "reload agents"
- "re-read AGENTS"
- "refresh AGENTS context"
